                Things happen, life can present you with unexpected things and you need to be prepared.
                This is a goal that you can set for yourself but a general rule of thumb is enough money for you to survive for 3-6 months.
                This money should be easily accessible in the event of an emergency and is probably best in a normal savings account.
