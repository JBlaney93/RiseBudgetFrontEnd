                You can open a LISA, a lifetime savings ISA. If you are saving for your first time purchase 
                of a home, this is a government supported scheme where the government will contribute +25% to your 
                savings each year, up to £4000 per year.
                So, if you max out your LISA contributions of £4000 in a tax year, the government will give you an 
                additional £1000 on top of this. If saving up for your first home is the main goal this is a fantastic route 
                to go down.
